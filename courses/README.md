# Welcome to Data Structures Tutorial!

## Overview:

`Note: Each of these modules will be in Python.` 

In this tutorial, we will cover the following data structures: queues, linked lists, and trees.
The following links will each go over the topics respectively.

* [Big-O Notation](/courses/performance/0-performance.md)
* [Queues](/courses/queues/1-queues.md) 
* [Linked Lists](/courses/linked_lists/2-linked_lists.md)
* [Trees](/courses/trees/3-trees.md)

In each module, we will describe each data structure, explain what it does and how it works, as well as determining the perfomance in Big O Notation individually.

There will also be examples in Python, as well as sample solutions.
